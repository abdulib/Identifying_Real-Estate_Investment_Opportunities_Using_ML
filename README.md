# Identifying Real Estate Investment Opportunities Using ML

## Defining The Problem (An Executive Level Report) 

**Objective Of The Project**
The objective of the project is to use machine learning to identify undervalued single-family homes for the purpose of real estate investment. We want to be able to know if a particular house listed for sale will be a good investment.

**Assumptions About the Data and The Problem**

Assumptions are that:
•	There are undervalued houses on the market
•	The features of available data are related to the value of homes such that they can give insights into the value of the home. That is the 
•	Economic conditions are normal (usual) for fair market value of a house

**An Approach Without Machine Learning**

Fair market value (FMV) is the price that a property would sell for on the open market under usual conditions. FMV is often different from the actual market value or the appraised value and is used in some property tax evaluations. Market valuation comes down to two factors: real estate appraisals and recent comparable sales. 
An appraisal is a professional opinion of value. Comparable sales, also known as the "market data" approach, is the most common way to arrive at market value. Here, the recent sales of properties of similar stature are reviewed to inform judgment. 

Other ways to determine the value of a home include the capitalization of income approach which values an investment based on the expectation of future benefits and the replacement cost new value approach which determines the current cost of constructing a property with the same utility using the current construction materials and adhering to current design standards and layouts.
